\section{Conclusions and Further developments}

\paragraph{?} In this work a method for computing a three-dimensional Pareto frontier is proposed. Additionally, an incremental approach to the frontier computation allows for a fast update of the latter. Furthermore, since it is built on top of a well-known algorithm for finding the optimal solutions of a set, it can perform both functions. For the same reason, the implementation of the method is simplified.
